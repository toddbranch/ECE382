#### Late Work

If problems arise with graded assignments, see your instructor in advance.  Assignments turned in later than the due date without prior permission from the instructor will be penalized as follows (note there is no distinction between "Duty Day" or "Day":

| How Late? | Penalty |
| :-: | :-: |
| 0 - 24 Hours | 10% |
| 24 - 48 Hours | 30% |
| 48 - 72 Hours | 60% |

### Course Materials

- **Course Text** - MSP430 Microcontroller Basics - John H. Davies (optional, but encouraged)

### Extra Instruction (EI) Policy

Schedule EI with your instructor if you are having difficulty with the course material.  You must have read the assignment and attempted the homework **before** requesting EI.  Note: You are responsible for material if you miss class, so get notes from someone in your section.  For example, if you miss the lesson where your instructor announces a quiz for the next lesson or the instructor assigns homework due next lesson, you are still responsible for the quiz, homework, or any other assignments made.  It is in your best interest to check with your classmates after an absence.  After you've read the assignment, attempted the homework, and checked with your classmates, you may then schedule EI if you have difficulty with the material - not to make up class.

### CAS Policy

You must request permission from your instructor for any class absence (with a descriptive reason - don't just send the SCA number) as soon as possible, preferably before the absence occurs.  You must use e-mail to notify your instructor.

### Collaboration Policy

For all assignments in this course, you may work with any faculty members or students **currently** enrolled in ECE382 unless otherwise indicated.  We expect all graded work, to include software programs, wired circuits, lab notebooks, and written reports, to be your own work.  If they aren't, you've copied and will receive **no academic credit** even if the copying is documented.  Further, copying without attribution is dishonorable and will be dealt with as a suspected honor code violation.  As in all courses, cadets must document any assistance received in the execution of graded work.  If you receive no assistance on an assignment, the use of the **Documentation: None** statement is mandatory.  If no documentation statement exists, the assignment will be returned for correction and the work will be considered at least one day late.

### Homework

Reading assignments are provided at the top of the lesson notes and should be accomplished **prior** to the designated class.  Homework assignments are also given at the top of the class notes and are due BOC the next lesson.

### Labs / Lab Notebooks

Labs will be turned in and graded via GitHub.  

### Exams

All exams are closed textbook and notes.  Cadets are allowed to use only the provided TI documents and data sheets for exams and quizzes.  Both laboratory and classroom work will appear on exams.  For missed GRs, the following policies are outlined:

- **Scheduled Absence** - If you know that you will be unable to take the GR during the scheduled GR period, you are required to inform your instructor as soon as possible before the GR to schedule a make-up exam.
- **Unscheduled Absense** - If you miss the GR for reasons beyond your control (e.g. hospitalization, emergency leave, delayed field trip return, etc.) you must contact DFEC (x3190) within **two working days** to schedule a make-up.  Exceptions can only be granted by the Department Head.

### Miscellaneous

This course is designed to help you in your development as an electrical and computer engineer.  Feel free to provide feedback on the lessons and labs at any time.  If you have ideas to improve or enhance the course, please let me know.  The class builds on concepts from the prerequisites, so it's important that you seek help as soon as you need it.  Procrastination is truly the enemy in an assembly language course.  A little foresight and planning and a lot of effort will result in an extremely rewarding experience serving as the basis for future microcontroller work.

Good luck!
